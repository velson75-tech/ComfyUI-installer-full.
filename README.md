# ComfyUI Desktop Installer

This project provides a **full Linux desktop installer** for ComfyUI with embedded Python, safe-launcher, rollback, and auto-update features.

## Features

- One-click installer for Linux
- GPU / CPU / Low-VRAM support
- Virtual environment included
- launcher.sh and safe_launcher.sh
- Demo GUI installer with progress bar
- Logs and diagnostics
- Portable mode
- !!!  Pre Alfa version (DEMO) !!!!
- It's important to me that someone implements this idea (one-click installation in Linux, with a dialog box). I'm not a programmer (I'm just learning :)

## Quick Start

1. Run `installer_full.sh`
2. Follow the GUI installer or terminal prompts
3. Launch ComfyUI via `launcher.sh` or `safe_launcher.sh`
4. Check `install.log` for errors
5. Optional auto-update or rollback (future improvement)

## Idea Visualization


Goal: provide a **desktop-like installer for Linux users**, similar to Windows one-click installers, ready to demonstrate to ComfyUI developers.
